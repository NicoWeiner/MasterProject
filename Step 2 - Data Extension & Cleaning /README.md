# Step 2 - Data Extension & Cleaning

This folder includes the code for extending and cleaning the scraped Immobilienscout24 dataset. Newly added variables include timetosell, average income, population density per city etc. 

The dataset of Funda had been provided by CMI of AUAS and has already been extended with such economic and demographic variables prior to the study. A data extension & cleaning notebook is hence not necessary for Funda.
